Your Rights
-----------

We understand that as you write stories and develop characters on our
website, there's a certain amount of trust you must place in us. We
recognize that your original work belongs to you. We will not steal your
original characters, stories, or any other original work. We won't try
to sell or publish your works. We won't even display them in a public
place without your consent.


Privacy
-------

RPNow is inherently anonymous. The only personal information that we
have access to is whatever you type into the chat, and the IP address
through which you visit and use the site.

We will not disclose any of this information to any third parties. We
may, however, use this information for our own internal purposes; that
is, we might skim over your RP's. We want to undertsand how people are
using this site, so that we can improve it to better suit your needs. We
also must moderate the content on our site, to ensure the service is not
used for any illegal or otherwise undesirable activity. We may also
generate statistical information which we may display publicly; however,
no publicly available statistics will include specific content from
individual roleplays unless we first get your consent.

We have taken multiple precautions to ensure that your data is secure,
such as using SSL encryption and being very careful to prevent common
web service attacks. However, if we become aware of a data breach, we
will let you know within 48 hours. Because we do not collect e-mail
addresses, we will announce it on the front page of the site, as well as
on the individual RP pages.

--------

This site and the RPNow service are provided "as is" without warranty of
any kind, either express or implied, including without limitation any
implied warranties of condition, uninterrupted use, merchantability,
fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
